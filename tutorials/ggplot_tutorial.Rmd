## Description or Objective
This script includes a basic introduction to ggplot2. This is a package that provides an easy & elegant plotting system for data manipulation and making graphics in R. It tries to take care of details (like legends, graphics, etc.) by default. 

## Example Script
```{r, echo=TRUE}

ls() #list variables
rm(list=ls()) #clear variables
ls() #list variables again (to check)

#setwd('/Users/juliejung/Desktop/') #set working directory
getwd() #show working directory (to check)

#install the package
#install.packages("ggplot2")

#load the libraries you'll need in your script
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(plyr)

## Gives count, mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and confidence interval (default 95%). ##
  ##   data: a data frame.
  ##   measurevar: the name of a column that contains the variable to be summariezed
  ##   groupvars: a vector containing names of columns that contain grouping variables
  ##   na.rm: a boolean that indicates whether to ignore NA's
  ##   conf.interval: the percent range of the confidence interval (default is 95%)

summarySE <- function(data=NULL, measurevar, groupvars=NULL, na.rm=FALSE,
                      conf.interval=.95, .drop=TRUE) {
  
  # New version of length which can handle NA's: if na.rm==T, don't count them
  length2 <- function (x, na.rm=FALSE) {
    if (na.rm) sum(!is.na(x))
    else       length(x)
  }
  
  # This does the summary. For each group's data frame, return a vector with
  # N, mean, and sd
  datac <- ddply(data, groupvars, .drop=.drop,
                 .fun = function(xx, col) {
                   c(N    = length2(xx[[col]], na.rm=na.rm),
                     mean = mean   (xx[[col]], na.rm=na.rm),
                     sd   = sd     (xx[[col]], na.rm=na.rm)
                   )
                 },
                 measurevar
  )
  
  # Rename the "mean" column    
  datac <- rename(datac, c("mean" = measurevar))
  
  datac$se <- datac$sd / sqrt(datac$N)  # Calculate standard error of the mean
  
  # Confidence interval multiplier for standard error
  # Calculate t-statistic for confidence interval: 
  # e.g., if conf.interval is .95, use .975 (above/below), and use df=N-1
  ciMult <- qt(conf.interval/2 + .5, datac$N-1)
  datac$ci <- datac$se * ciMult
  
  return(datac)
}

## For the GGPLOT ANALYSIS ##

# read in your data
# format is read.csv(file="my.csv.filename")
VOR.df<-read.csv(file="VORforR-kw1.csv") # name it something predictable
# take a subset of your metadata, if that's helpful
tactile <- subset(VOR.df, Stimulus == "T", na.rm=T, select=c(Clutch, AgeBlock, Individual, Response, AverageR2, Average.Amp, DiffRandL, HatchTime, HatchAge, HsinceH))
#In this example, VOR.df is the metadataframe and tactile is the subset of only the data that I think I'll need (i.e. only when Stimulus == "T")
# select: choose only the columns you think you'll need from your metadata. 

# actual plot command
ggplot(tactile, aes(x=AgeBlock, y=Average.Amp, color=Response)) 
# format is ggplot(dataframe, aes(x=nameX, y=nameY, color = nameZ)) 
# aes is aesthetic mapping of x, y, alpha, colour, fill, shape, size. 
+ geom_point(shape=1) #scatter points
+ scale_colour_hue(l=50) #scale color hue of points
+ geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression trendline through all points
            se=FALSE,    # Don't add shaded confidence region
            fullrange=TRUE) # Extend regression lines
+ ylab("Average Amplitude") # Add x-labels for your plot
+ xlab("Hours Since First Hatch") # Add y-labels for your plot

##save the output as a figure onto your working directory. 
#ggsave(“filename.jpg”)

```


## Additional resources
This is an example script of a basic ggplot, but there are many many resources out there for you to learn more and add more details to your figure. Here (http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) is a current list of functions that you can choose to include in your script, depending on what information you want to convey. Here (http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/shape) is a useful shape guide.
